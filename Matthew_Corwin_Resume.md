## Summary

Technical Product Architect who turns ideas into working MVPs fast. Years of coding fundamentals combined with AI-augmented development means I prototype in days what traditionally takes weeks—then communicate effectively with senior engineers to harden and scale. I see the big picture, understand the technical details, speak the language, and ship.
