# Prompt: Build an Interactive "About Me" Page Component

## Context
I need a React component for my portfolio site (mattcorwin.dev) that displays my resume/about info in a visually engaging way. The site already has an MVP showcase section with project cards. This should feel cohesive but stand out as a personal story page.

## What I Want

Create a React component (or set of components) for an "About" or "Experience" page that:

1. **Looks modern and engaging** — not a boring resume dump. Think subtle animations, clean typography, visual hierarchy
2. **Tells my story** — the narrative is: long-time tinkerer + AI tools = rapid prototyper who ships
3. **Highlights the key stuff:**
   - Summary/intro section
   - Skills displayed visually (maybe chips, bars, or a creative layout)
   - Timeline or cards for experience
   - Link to projects (or embed project cards if already built)
4. **Fits a dark or modern tech aesthetic** — my site is a portfolio for a Technical Product Architect
5. **Has some interactivity** — hover effects, scroll animations, expandable sections, or similar
6. **Is responsive** — works on mobile

### Tech Preferences
- React (functional components, hooks)
- Tailwind CSS preferred (or styled-components)
- Framer Motion for animations would be cool
- TypeScript if the project uses it

### Optional Ideas (pick what works)
- Animated typing effect for the summary
- Skills as an interactive cloud or grid
- Timeline with expandable job details
- "Download Resume" button that links to PDF
- Smooth scroll sections
- Parallax or subtle background effects

## Deliverable
A React component (or page) I can drop into my Next.js site. Include any dependencies I'd need to install. Keep it modular so I can tweak sections.
